              travelling. Some leading insurers offering jewellery protection
              include:

              What is Engagement Ring Insurance?
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
              Engagement ring insurance allows you to protect your ring against
              accidental loss, theft, or damage both inside and outside your
              home. While some home insurance policies include basic coverage, a
              dedicated jewellery policy provides better protection, especially
              for valuable or sentimental pieces.

              Why Do You Need Jewellery Insurance?
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
              Jewellery insurance can’t replace the emotions attached to your
              jewellery, but it can protect you from financial loss. Whether
              your ring is misplaced, damaged, or stolen, a good insurance
              policy will help you recover the value through repair,
              replacement, or reimbursement.

              Benefits of Jewellery Insurance
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
              With proper insurance coverage, you can rest assured that your
              jewellery investment is secure. A standard jewellery insurance
              policy typically covers:
              <ol className="mx-10 list-decimal">
                <li>Accidental loss or damage</li>
                <li>Theft or burglary</li>
                <li>Loss of stones or settings</li>
                <li>Damage during travel</li>
                <li>Fire and other unforeseen incidents</li>
              </ol>
              You can also choose to insure multiple items together, including
              engagement rings, wedding bands, or heirloom pieces. Consult your
              insurance provider for detailed coverage and terms.
