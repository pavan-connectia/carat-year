              What Is A Valuation Report?
            </h2>
            <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
              Valuation Reports allow you to insure your items of jewellery at
              the full replacement price for the high street. This is not
              necessarily the same amount as the price paid due to the potential
              cost of replacement, and the fact that we have various sales
              offers throughout the year.

            <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
              Our Valuation Reports mean that your insurance company has an
              accurate replacement value, should your jewellery get damaged,
              lost or stolen.

            <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
              Our Valuation Reports are provided free of charge with each item
              purchased from us. Valuation Reports include all the specifics of
              the piece of jewellery, including diamond colour and clarity. The
              Valuation Report will also have a picture, showing the design of
              the jewellery.

              What is Engagement Ring Insurance?
            </h2>
            <p className="mt-4 text-gray-600">
              Engagement ring insurance allows you to protect your ring against
              accidental loss, theft, or damage both inside and outside your
              home. While some home insurance policies include basic coverage, a
              dedicated jewellery policy provides better protection, especially
              for valuable or sentimental pieces.
